                        <h1>Molokai</h1>
                        <p>
                            Affectionately known as the “Friendly Isle”, Molokai is the fifth largest of the Hawaiian
                            Islands.
                            <br>
                            With a tiny population of around 7000, the delightfully slow pace of life is an attractive
                            trait in a day trip, particularly for those who are looking for some peace and quiet.
                            <br>
                            There also happens to be an incredible number of interesting sites for the intrepid
                            traveller seeking some insight into the island’s past.
                            <br>
                            Head over to Kamalo, where, thanks to the high concentration of native Hawaiians, you can
                            find traditional taro patches and other agricultural marvels.
                            <br>
                            It is said that hula was also born here, and this ancient dance can be observed at the
                            island’s Ka Hula Piko event, where you can also experience an abundance of delicious,
                            authentic cuisine.

                        <h1>Pearl Harbour</h1>
                        <p>
                            The number one attraction in Oahu, indeed, in the whole of Hawaii, the chance to visit the
                            incredibly significant site of Pearl Harbour should not be missed.
                            <br>
                            The site itself commemorates the lives lost, as well as the precursors and repercussions of
                            the Japanese attack on the harbour in 1941. It is extensive and intriguing in its level of
                            detail.
                            <br>
                            There are two museums: the “Road to War” and the “Attack Museum,” which depict the events
                            of the Second World War.
                            <br>
                            The Pearl Harbour Visitor Center gives you the chance to go on narrated tours to various
                            nearby areas, such as Ford Island or the USS Oklahoma memorial center.
